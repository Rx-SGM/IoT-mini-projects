# IoT-mini-projects
Contains several mini IoT based sensor projects comprising of the screenshots and videos of validated functioning and program files in Python. 
Hardware configuration of all the projects have facilitated by Bolt IoT Wifi Module supplemented with sensors and buzzers included in the external package which was bought from BoltIoT.
Software integrations have been made via the Bolt library in Python and hosted on a virtual linux server by DigitalOcean. PuTTY was used to SSH into the server using credentials. A basic CPU with a standard size was chosen as a dedicated CPU would incur substantial charges.
